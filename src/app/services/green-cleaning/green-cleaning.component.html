          <p>Focusing on providing healthy and safe janitorial services, ISA CLEAN'S comprehensive green-clean initiative helps
          reduce contaminants that harm the earth and promote sustainability. Our environmentally friendly and responsible approach
          focuses on the proper training and use of green, chemical-free cleaning solutions as well as proper disposal of any harsh
          detergents/cleaning compounds. ISA CLEAN’S environmentally conscious cleaning approach highlights the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Environmentally safe cleaning solutions: we use only environmentally friendly products that promote reusability, eco-friendly
            packaging and natural materials, most of which have earned the independent Green Seal of approval.</li>
          <li>Microfiber systems: our microfiber mops and clothes allow us to remove more than 99 percent of dirt, dust and germs using
            fewer products.</li>
          <li>Multi-filtration (HEPA/ULPA) vacuums: all our vacuums receive approval through the Carpet &amp; Rug Institute’s Green Label
            program, leaving three times fewer particles in the air in comparison to other cleaning services.</li>
          <li>Specialized chemical dispensing systems: in order to reduce the impact of our non-toxic products, we train our cleaning
            staff in the proper use of our green cleaning solution, making sure they use the exact right amount.</li>
          <li>Floor matting: in every Green Building, recycled floor mats are the first line of defense in preventing contaminants from
            getting into the building.</li>
        </ul>
