<p>Designing professional, modern and functional websites with the best User eXperience is what we pride ourselves
  in.&nbsp;That's because each and every project we deliver follows a strategic process that produces unique results
  for our customers and their customers.</p>
<h3>From small startups to large business websites</h3>
<p>Whether you are a small start up looking for a basic and affordable website or if you are a large multi national
  company looking to reinvigorate your corporate image and positioning in the market we can craft a tailored website
  package to suit your specific requirements.</p>
<h3>Planning and project management</h3>
<p>Right from the onset we assess all of the tasks at hand and work with you to implement the best action plan. Project
  management is a key part of every web design project we adopt. By developing wire-frames for your project you get a
  clear blueprint of your project.</p>
<h3>Web design</h3>
<p>What you see as a beautifully simple website doesn't happen easily. Our qualified team of web designers and
  developers follow best practices and use their vast knowledge and experience to take the complexities of your ideas
  and produce a website that offers the best User eXperience. Each and every website we design is user focused ensuring
  each stage of the web design process has kept the needs of your users front and centre.</p>
<h3>Your website will be built to industry standards</h3>
<p>With all the different web browsers and platforms available today, it's more important than ever to have your
  website built on solid foundations. Startup Designs follows strict standards when building websites. This means your
  website will be built to the standards of the chosen platform, whether it be Drupal, WordPress or a custom PHP
  application. This ensures your website is portable and can be understood by any qualified developer.</p>
<h3>Responsive web design</h3>
<p>A responsive website is one that 'responds' to the end user. This means that your website will resize and/or
  re-format its content to suit the user's device, platform or browser. We do this by creating multiple layouts of your
  website, which display depending on the size of the screen being used.</p>
