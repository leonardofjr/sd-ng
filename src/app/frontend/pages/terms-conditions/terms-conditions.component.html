              <h2>These terms and conditions shall govern the use of the Startup Designs website and the purchase of any goods or services from it.</h2>
              <p>By using Startup Designs's web design service, and signing up as a client, you agree to be legally bound by these terms and Conditions, including those incorporated by reference. Please read these terms carefully. Acceptance of these terms and conditions stated here is a prerequisite to using the Startup Designs service.</p>
              <p>Startup Designs may revise these terms and conditions at any time by updating this posting. If the terms and conditions are revised, the original terms accepted by the client for a project will remain valid. In these terms and conditions, Startup Designs, the Startup Designs service, all services related to it, and all text, images, photographs, user interface, "look" and "feel", data and other content included in it from time to time (including, without limitation, the selection, coordination and arrangement of such content) are referred to as the "web site" or "service."</p>
              <h3>1. Description</h3>
              <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>1.1</strong> The Startup Designs service is an online offering where individuals or entities that have signed up with Startup Designs as clients ("client") can post via e-mail or via the web site specific assignments and project descriptions, including illustrative samples or other media, ("creative brief"), revise those creative briefs ("revision brief") and obtain responses ("response") to those creative or revision briefs from design experts retained by Startup Designs ("the company").</p>
                  <p><strong>1.2</strong> Clients will be provided the service according to the estimate accepted by the client. Client’s responses will be created iteratively through a drafting cycle of creative briefs, revision briefs and responses, ultimately resulting in a final response conforming to client’s various creative and revision briefs.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3>2. Creative brief and responses</h3>
              <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>2.1</strong> Each client is solely responsible for preparing and posting detailed descriptions of each of its creative briefs, including providing samples illustrating client’s creative brief ("samples"), site structure, number of pages required, the applicable deadline, and other relevant terms and conditions.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.2</strong> The company is under no obligation to review a creative or revision brief for any purpose, including accuracy, completeness of information, quality or clarity. An initial response will be of the same calibre as the examples in the company portfolio. The company may decide, in its sole discretion, to decline to respond to a creative or revision brief.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.3</strong> The company is under no obligation to supply responses that differ substantially from their style, as it is assumed that the client has selected the company based on previous projects represented in its portfolio. Initial responses are supplied within 5 working days of payment being received.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.4</strong> If photography is required in the design, the client must supply the company with adequate photography; or the company will recommend a stock photography bundle to suit the project at an additional cost to the client.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3>3. Client review of response</h3>
              <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>3.1</strong> If a client fails to inform the company within 5 working days that the response does not reasonably conform to the creative brief, the client will be deemed to have accepted the response. If a client notifies the company that the response does not reasonably conform to the creative brief, the client shall submit information regarding amendments or modifications to be made to the initial response ("revision brief").</p>
                  <p><strong>3.2</strong> After providing a revision brief, the client will be provided with a subsequent response that conforms to the additional criteria requested by the client, free of charge. However, concepts provided in the initial response cannot be used after the second response has been given.</p>
                  <p><strong>3.3</strong> Notification of acceptance or decline of any response shall be made in writing by the client ("signing off")</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3>4. Responses</h3>
              <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>4.1</strong> The company is not responsible for the content of responses developed to the extent that such responses are based on conformity with client’s creative or revision briefs.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3>5. Revision cycles</h3>
              <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>5.1</strong> Revision cycles consist of 1 additional composition that incorporates changes requested by the client in the revision brief. The client is responsible for providing constructive feedback for each revision cycle. The purpose of the revision process is to create responses that move forward in a specific direction as determined by the client.</p>
                  <p><strong>5.2</strong> The client may request significant changes in the 1st cycle, and the response might be quite different in nature from the original composition chosen. By the 2nd revision request, client’s requests shall be modifications of the current composition only.</p>
                  <p><strong>5.3</strong> Revision requests that depart from the current composition will be honoured and completed in the same timely manner, however; the company reserves the right to quote accordingly for each such revision.</p>
                  <p><strong>5.4</strong> No revision work, which requires payment, will be started without authorisation from the client. Revision cycles are supplied for free within each package, and therefore cannot be refunded or exchanged for other services. Revision cycles are supplied within 5 working days of receiving the revision brief.</p>
                  <p><strong>5.5</strong> Unless otherwise stated, each project includes three revision cycles after the initial work or concept is presented. Revisions requested after the third revision will be charged at the company's standard hourly rate</p>
                  <p><strong>5.6</strong> Notification of acceptance or decline of any revision shall be made in writing by the client ("signing off")</p>
                  <p><strong>5.7</strong> Once the revision process is complete and the client has accepted all revisions, the project is then known as the "final product".</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3>6. Proofing</h3>
              <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>6.1</strong> The company shall make every effort to ensure the final product is free of any grammatical and spelling errors, before giving the final product to the client.</p>
                  <p><strong>6.2</strong> It is agreed that it is the client’s responsibility to ensure that there are no spelling or grammatical errors contained in the final product.</p>
                  <p><strong>6.3</strong> It is agreed that the company is not responsible or held liable for any errors contained in the final product after the final product has been committed to print or posted in view of the public.</p>
                  <p><strong>6.4</strong> It is the sole responsibility of the client to notify the company of any such errors during the revision cycle and before the final files have been generated. If a further revision is required an additional revision charge will be incurred.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3>7. Final files</h3>
              <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>7.1</strong> Once the client approves of the design, notifies the company and pays any outstanding invoices for design and/or development, final HTML, images and other web files will be uploaded to the client’s website or supplied to the client directly. If the client requires further revisions after this time, the company will recommend a web maintenance bundle to the client at an additional cost.</p>
                  <p><strong>7.2</strong> Artwork files or website backups will be available to the client on request. Once-off website backups incur a fee and will need to be quoted on and approved by the client beforehand. Final files include all files necessary to serve the website only. Additional constraints, including specifications on PHP applications, HTML structure and layout, are not included in the package and the company will supply the client with a quotation for any additional specifications required. All files and fonts are supplied in PC format.</p>
                  <p><strong>7.3</strong> Additional file formats, including variations on the chosen design, are not included in the package and the company will supply the client with a quotation for any additional formats or Revisions that are required.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.1</strong> Unless otherwise stated in the approved quotation, it is assumed that the website will be deployed on the company’s web server with an appropriate hosting package purchased from the company.</p>
                  <p><strong>8.2</strong> If the client is not using a hosting package purchased from the company, it is the responsibility of the client to supply the company with a web space which supports any technologies used within the website and all authentication details necessary to upload the files.</p>
                  <p><strong>8.3</strong> Deployment to a site not installed on the company's web server will be charged at the company's standard hourly rate.</p>
                  <p><strong>8.4</strong> The company will endeavour to deploy a site in the time frame requested by the client but the company cannot guarantee deployment time frame. Revision requests, circumstances beyond the company's control or other factors may delay a deployment.</p>
                  <p><strong>8.5</strong> Client sites will not be deployed until invoices for development work are paid in full.</p>
              </blockquote>
